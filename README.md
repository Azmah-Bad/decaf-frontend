# decaf ☕️

*THIS IDEA DEFENITLY WENT TOO FUCKING FAR*

this as a basic app that allows user to keep track of his caffeine intake through the day (beleive it or not, shit cost 15e a month on the app store so i made my own).

the app is built with ionic/angular in the frontend which make it avalible on the phones all the time and _downlaodable_.

the app home page contains the caffeine intake of the day with 2 _cute_ buttons that the user will press when he drinks soda or coffee (maybe add energy drinks later on)

app should warn the user by playing dancing coffin ⚰️ song when user had too much caffeine 

2nd tab dispays a graph of the user consmuption throughout the week or month and maybe history of his consumption

## this isn't a seriouse project by any means but rather a way for me to learn web technologies
